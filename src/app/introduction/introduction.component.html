  <div class="presentation-bg">
    <p class="lead mb-3">
      Hi, I’m Mounir Guizani, a 34-year-old Fullstack Developer with 9 years of experience
      delivering robust, maintainable, and business-oriented software solutions.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-3">
      I’ve built most of my career around the Java ecosystem, working on the back end of complex,
      enterprise-grade applications. Along the way, I’ve also contributed on the front end —
      particularly with Angular — enabling me to support fullstack needs when required, while
      maintaining a strong focus on architecture and logic.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-3">
      Throughout my journey, I’ve had the opportunity to work across a wide range of architectural
      models — from legacy monoliths to microservices, backend-for-frontend (BFF) setups, and
      domain-driven design (DDD). These experiences have shaped my ability to tackle technical
      challenges with adaptability and precision, always keeping business value in sight.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-3">
      Over the past year, I’ve also taken on a dual role as a Scrum Master, blending hands-on
      development with team coordination and agile facilitation. This has reinforced my leadership
      skills and sharpened my focus on efficient, value-driven delivery.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-3">
      Naturally curious and driven, I’m someone who thrives on complex challenges — I’m always eager
      to learn, go deeper, and push boundaries. Whether it’s mastering a new concept or untangling a
      tough technical issue, I bring energy and persistence to every project.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-3">
      Fluent in both code and collaboration, I strive to bridge business needs and technical
      execution through pragmatic, scalable solutions. I'm also comfortable operating in
      DevOps-ready environments using Docker and Kubernetes.
    </p>
